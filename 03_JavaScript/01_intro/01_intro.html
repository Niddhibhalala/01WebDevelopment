    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>difference between HTML,CSS and JavaScript</p>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <P>HTML is a functional Language.HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web
        content, for example defining
        paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</P>

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <P>CSS is a styling language CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for
        example setting
        background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</P>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <P>JavaScript is a dynamic language/scripting language that enables you to create dynamically
        updating content, control multimedia,
        animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve
        with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</P>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It
        is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and
        many non-browser environments also use it.

        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive <b>(e.g.,
            having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).</b>
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D
        and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>

    <h2>Why JS??</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a default choice for web
            development. There are many frameworks available which you can use to create web applications once you have
            learned JavaScript.</li>
        <li>JavaScript offers lots of flexibility. You can create stunning and fast web applications with tons of
            customizations to provide users with the most relevant graphical user interface.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is now also used in mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This
            opens many possibilities for you as a Javascript developer.</li>
        <li>Due to the high demand in the industry, there are tons of job growth opportunities and high pay for those
            who know JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The incredible thing about Javascript is that you can find tons of frameworks and libraries already
            developed, which can be used directly in web development. That reduces the development time and enhances the
            graphical user interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>JS Engine</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript Engine is a program whose responsibility is to execute JavaScript code. All modern browsers come
        with their own version of the JavaScript Engine but the most popular one is Google’s V8 Engine. Google’s V8
        engine powers Google Chrome browsers, as well as, Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is used to build
        server-side applications outside of the browser.</p>
