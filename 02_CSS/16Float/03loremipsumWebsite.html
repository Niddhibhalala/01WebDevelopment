            <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
            <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>
                is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col float-r">
            <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                letters,
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
                for
                'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
                years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

            <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                Lorem
                Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                undoubtable
                source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                popular
                during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
                in
                section 1.10.32.
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                Sections
                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
                original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

            <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
            <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration
                in
                some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
                going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in
                the
                middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
                words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                reasonable.
                The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                non-characteristic
                words etc.</p>

                <h4>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h4>
                <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
                    avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
                    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
                    loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
                    circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
                    example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage
                    from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
                    annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

                <h4>Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC</h4>
                <p>"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum
                    deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non
                    provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum
                    fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis
                    est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis
                    voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis
                    aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non
                    recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus
                    maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."</p>

                <h4>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h4>
                <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                    demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
                    the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
                    duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                    These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
                    is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
                    to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
                    or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
                    annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
                    selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid
                    worse pains."
